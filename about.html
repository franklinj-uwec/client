            <p>Tripleshot Expresso was originally thought up in 2008, when CEO and Founder Art Vandelay was hanging out with his friends in Northeastern Wisconsin. As they were drinking, Art wondered if it was possible for his beer to taste like coffee, since it was 9AM on a Tuesday.<br>Art gave up his previous job as a career mathematician in order to make the beer coffee.<br>Ten years and many unpaid loans later, Vandelay made his completed product. His first drink, the Drunken Mocha, made it's way to the market on December 8, 2018.<br>Now it is a large market in Wisconsin, headquartered right here on Water Street in Eau Claire.</p>
